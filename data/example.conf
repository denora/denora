 * Denora configuration file (Example)
 * *************************
 *
 * After making the appropriate changes to this file, place it in the
 * Denora data directory (as specified in the "Config" script, default
 * /usr/local/lib/denora) under the name "denora.conf".
 *
 * The configuration format consists of blocks, each containing name-value
 * pairs, tags, or string data.  It is designed to be easily readable by
 * both human beings and Denora.
 * 
 * A block consists of a block name, an opening '{' brace, statements, a
 * closing '}' brace, and a ';' semicolon.  A statement consists of a
 * name, possibly followed by a value, and ending with a semicolon.
 * Strings that contain special characters or whitespace can be surrounded
 * by '"' double quotes.  All elements of the configuration are separated
 * by whitespace, and can be packed on one line, or broken up over several
 * lines.
 */
 
 # Comments are supported in three forms:
     /* C style
        multi-line */
     # shell style single-line
     // C++ style single-line

/*
 * A sample block:
 * 
 *     block {
 *         name value;            # A statement with a name value
 *         name 123;              # A statement with a number value
 *         name "hello world";    # A statement with a string value
 *         tag;                   # A simple tag
 *         "will code for food";  # A simple string
 *     };
 * 
 * You can also use an include directive outside of a block context, if
 * you want to split up your configuration in several files:
 * 
 *     include path/to/file.conf;
 *
 * In the documentation for each directive, one of the following will be
 * included to indicate whether an option is required:
 *
 * [REQUIRED]
 *    Indicates a block which must be given
 *    Without it, Denora will not start.
 *
 * [RECOMMENDED]
 *    Indicates a block which may be omitted, but omitting it may cause
 *    undesirable side effects.
 *
 * [OPTIONAL]
 *    Indicates a block which is optional. If not given, the feature
 *    will typically be disabled.  If this is not the case, more
 *    information will be given in the documentation.
 *
 * NOTE: unless other specified, there may be only one block with the
 *       same name.

# Connect [REQUIRED]
#   Information needed for Denora to connect to the uplink server.
#
# Required tokens:
#  hostname    - Remote server hostname
#                This must either be a standard Internet hostname
#                or dotted-quad numeric address
#                This may be overridden at runtime with the "-remote"
#                command-line option.
#  port        - Remote server port
#                This must be an integer between 1 and 65535
#  passwd      - Password to send to the uplink server
#                The password is a string which should be enclosed in
#                double quotes if it contains any spaces
#                This may be overridden at runtime with the "-remote"
#                command-line option.
#  protocol    - IRCd protocol to use.
#                Choose one of the following, depending on your ircd:
#                  Asuka IRCu          : asuka
#                  Bahamut 1.4 and 1.8 : bahamut

#
# Optional tokens:
#  bindhost    - IP to connect from
#                This pecifies the local address to bind to before
#                connecting to the remote server. This may be useful
#                on multihomed hosts. If this is not specified, Stats
#                will let the operating system choose the local address.
#  bindport    - Port number to connect from
#                If only a bindhost is specified, Stats will bind to that
#                address but let the operating system choose the local
#                port number.
#  quitprefix  - IRCd quit prefix (case sensitive!)
#                This is used by Denora to parse Quit messages in order to
#                detect Local kills from IRCds which don't send a specific
#                KILL event, like Unreal32.
#                Common prefixes:

# StatServ [REQUIRED]
#   Specify the nickname and "real" name for the Stats pseudoclient.
#
# Required tokens:

#                When a user will /msg "aliasnick" something, it will be
#                forwarded to "nick", and "nick" will answer. This can be
#                used to ease the migration from another network, for

#  autoop      - Makes the bot get mode +o on channels
#  automode    - autoop mode
#                If autoop is enabled, this allows you to specify the

# Backup [RECOMMENDED]
#   Specify information on when Denora will do backups of the .db files

###########################################################################
# Netinfo [REQUIRED]
#   Specify various network-related information and settings
#
# Required tokens:
#  name             - Network's name where Denora is running on
#
# Optional tokens:
#  numeric          - Numeric ID
#                     Sets the numeric Denora should have. If your IRCd
#                     has a numeric, Denora will need one too. Consult
#                     your ircd's documentation before using this.
#  nickchar         - Sets the nickchar encoding for UnrealIRCd 3.2
#                     Only needed if you use that ircd. See the Unreal
#                     documentation for more information about this.
#  hiddenprefix     - Prefix for hidden hosts on P10-based ircds
#  hiddensuffix     - Suffix for hidden hosts on P10-based ircds
#  ctcpusers        - Get the CTCP version from users
#                     The users connecting to your network will receive
#                     a ctcp version request from the Denora bot.
#  ctcpeob          - Disable CTCP during burst
#                     Avoid sending out ctcp requests to users during burst.
#                     This is only useful if you restart Denora often and
#                     don't want to annoy your users.
#                     "ctcpusers" still needs to be enabled.
#  nonicktracking   - Disable Nick Tracking.
#                     This will disable nick tracking, including the
#                     automatic nick merging. Use this if you want to
#                     lower the SQL load.
#  largenet         - Disable extended features
#                     This will do everything what "nonicktracking" does,
#                     and additionally disable: chanstats, host lookup, tld,
#                     ctcpusers, statserv alias, motd, server bans, channel
#                     bans, server uptime and server version.
#                     We don't recommend using this. It's only done for
#                     people who use a remote SQL database and really need
#                     to reduce the query load.
#  ustatsregistered - Only track registered users
#                     Enable this to only track registered (+r) users in
#                     chanstats. This will reduce the risk of nick
#                     confusion and require users to register to services
#                     in order to be tracked by chanstats.
#  sphtml           - Hide +s/+p channels from HTML stats
#                     This only applies for HTML output, not for SQL. To
#                     hide those channels from SQL, just use an appropriate
#                     database query.
#  excludeserv      - Exclude any user from this server
#                     This only applies for HTML output, not for SQL. To
#                     hide those servers from SQL, just use an appropriate
#                     database query.
#  statspage        - URL for Web Stats
#                     This will be advertised in the Denora reply to the
#                     STATS command. Put a link to your HTML output file,
#                     or to phpDenora, for example.

# Timeout [REQUIRED]
#   Specify various timeout options for performing certain operations
#
# Note: the timeout values are not an absolute limit on the period between
# checks of the timeout list: the period may be as great as the read token
# during periods of inactivity.
#
# Required tokens:
#  read        - Period for reading from network.
#  warning     - Interval for sending messages for program errors.
#                This token sets the interval between sending warning
#                messages for program errors via WALLOPS/GLOBOPS.
#  update      - Time between saving long term data to disk
#  htmlupdate  - Time between exporting the html files
#  pingfreq    - Time between pinging servers to check for lag
#  uptimefreq  - Time between uptime servers to check
#  sqlfreq     - Time between checking if the sql server is there
#  clearinactive     - Clear inactive users from chanstats
#  clearchaninactive - Clear inactive channels from chanstats
#  usercache   - The amount of time which we must keep users in the user
#                table. Since users connect/disconnect very often, it is
#                reasonable to keep this at a low value such as 2 days to
#                avoid filling the table with too much data.
#                If using applications that rely on user information, such
#                as a Denora module or phpDenora, it is recommended to set
#                this to a higher value such as 30 days, if possible.
#  userfreq    - How often (in seconds) to check for obsoleted users?
#                This shouldn't be set any higher than 10 seconds, and 1
#                second is best if your system is powerful enough (or your
#                network small enough) to handle it. 0 will cause the
#                timeout list to be checked every time through the main
#                loop, which will probably slow down Stats too much to be
#                useful on most networks.
#  servercache - The amount of time which we must keep servers in the
#                server table.  Since servers split are uncommon, we keep
#                them for a week.
#                If using applications that rely on server information,
#                such as a Denora module or phpDenora, it is recommended to
#                set this to a higher value such as 30 days, if possible.

# Options [OPTIONAL]
#   Configures various options for Denora itself.
#
# Optional tokens:
#  keeplogs    - Number of days log files are kept
#                This sets the number of days log files are kept. If you
#                don't give it, or if you set it to 0, logs will be kept
#                indefinitely. NOTE: Denora must run 24 hours a day for
#                this feature to work.
#  logchan     - Channel used for Denora for output logs.
#                When defined, Denora will output log messages to this
#                channel. IMPORTANT: This can be a security risk so make
#                certain this channel is sufficiently protected from normal
#                access.
#  dumpcore    - Dump core on segmentation faults.
#                This will make Denora dump core when a segmentation fault
#                occurs. This is generally not needed, but if Denora is
#                crashing on your network and you want to make a bug
#                report, having a core file may be of great help.
#  hidestatso  - Only show stats o to IRC Operators.
#  tokens      - Allows IRC Networks to use TOKEN commands.
#                This allows IRC networks to use TOKEN commands instead of
#                the standard commands. This saves bandwidth.
#  ts6         - Use TS6 code on IRCD that use it
#  chanstatsdef - Default flag for ChanStats Fantasy commands
#                   off = default
#                   on  = enabled but will message the results
#                   notice = enabled and will notice the results
#  smiley      - Default smileys used by chanstats
#  hideuline   - hide ulines from hmtl/xml output
#  nologs      - only use if you want NO log files
#  trigger     - character to use for triggering chanstats
#  jupemaster  - name of the server who issues JUPE so leafs can be ignored
