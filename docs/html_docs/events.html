<br />
1) Introduction to Internal Events<br />
<br />
    Internal Events are setup to give module developers more information
    about what the core is doing at different times. This information can
    be as complex as data we are feeding to the uplink, to simple triggered
    events such as the databases being saved. A list of triggered  events
    can be found below. Additional there is a module included with the core
    which can  provide some clue as to how to use the code in your modules.
    The rest of this document assumes that you are used to writing modules.<br />
<br />
2) Complex Events<br />
<br />
    This type of events are based around what happens when we talk to the
    IRCd, much like MESSAGE events that the IRCD sends to us. The events
    are triggered when Denora writes to the ircd. To watch for these events
    you must have some knowledge of how the IRCd command system works. In
    our example we will trap for NICK events.<br />
<br />
    A) All functions most be formatted as:<br />
<br />
        int functioname(char *source, int ac, char **av);<br />
<br />
    B) In DenoraInit you must declare EvtMessage in some fashion, it is into
       this variable that we will create the event handler. Here is what the
       base DenoraInit should look like at this point:<br />
<br />
        int DenoraInit(int argc, char **argv)<br />
        {<br />
            EvtMessage *msg = NULL;<br />
            int status;<br />
<br />
            moduleAddAuthor(AUTHOR);<br />
            moduleAddVersion(VERSION);<br />
            return MOD_CONT;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
       Note that AUTHOR and VERSION should be defined above the DenoraInit
       function, just like you should do with any module.<br />
<br />
    C) Pass "createEventHandler" the name of the message in this case NICK,
       and the function that was created in Step A. At this point you should
       assign the return of "createEventHandler" to the EvtMessage variable.<br />
<br />
        msg = createEventHandler("NICK", my_nick);<br />
<br />
    D) The Handler is not ready for use yet; now you must add it to the hash
       with "moduleAddEventHandler". You will want to pass to this function
       the return of "createEventHandler".<br />
<br />
        status = moduleAddEventHandler(msg);<br />
<br />
       It will return the same module error codes as adding a regular message,
       which you can use to confirm it was added correctly.<br />
<br />
    E) With that setup in your function you will be passed 3 items. The source
       most of the time this will be set to ServerName or NULL; consult our
       IRCd documentation about how messages are formatted. AC is the count of
       variables you will find in AV.<br />
<br />
        int my_nick(char *source, int ac, char **av)<br />
        {<br />
            alog(LOG_NORMAL, "Internal Event - nick is %s",av[0]);<br />
            return MOD_CONT;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
3) Triggered Events<br />
<br />
    These events also known as "event hooks" are internal events such as
    expiring of nicks to the saving of databases.<br />
<br />
    A) All functions most be formatted as:<br />
<br />
        int functioname(int argc, char **argv);<br />
<br />
    B) In DenoraInit you must declare EvtHook in some fashion; it is into
       this variable that we will create the event handler. Here is what
       the base DenoraInit should look like at this point:<br />
<br />
        int DenoraInit(int argc, char **argv)<br />
        {<br />
            EvtHook *hook = NULL;<br />
            int status;<br />
<br />
            moduleAddAuthor(AUTHOR);<br />
            moduleAddVersion(VERSION);<br />
            return MOD_CONT;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
    C) Pass "createEventHook" the name of the event. In this case we are
       going to hook to the saving of databases, "EVENT_DB_SAVING".<br />
<br />
        hook = createEventHook(EVENT_DB_SAVING, my_save);<br />
<br />
    D) The Handler is not ready for use yet; now you must add it to the hash
       with "moduleAddEventHook". You will want to pass to this function the
       return of "createEventHook"<br />
<br />
        status = moduleAddEventHook(hook);<br />
<br />
       It will return the same module error codes as adding a regular message,
       which you can use to confirm it was added correctly.<br />
<br />
    E) With that setup in your function you will be passed 1 item. The message
       is very simple; it could be as simple as a start, stop or message. In
       the case of saving it has a start and stop.<br />
<br />
        int my_save(int argc, char **argv)<br />
        {<br />
            if (!stricmp(argv[0], EVENT_START)) {<br />
                alog("Saving the databases! has started");<br />
            } else {<br />
                alog("Saving the databases is complete");<br />
            }<br />
            return MOD_CONT;<br />
        }<br />
<br />
4) Triggered Events List<br />
<br />
    Here's a list of all event hooks we currently offer, with a description
    of what argument is being passed to the event functions for this type of
    event. All arguments are plain-text strings (char *). The list is sorted
    in alphabetical order.<br />
<br />
    Note that all events are emitted AFTER the action has taken place, so
    any deleted nick/channel/etc. won't exist anymore and any created one will
    exist when your function is being run, unless noted otherwise.<br />
<br />
    Also note that EVENT_START and EVENT_STOP should not be matched with an
    equal sign, but with string comparison. See the bundled events module for
    an example on how to do this.<br />

        the process of restarting the core is. With EVENT_START, stats are<br />
        still fully online and operating. With EVENT_STOP, every internal clean<br />
        up has been done already, and the SQUIT has been sent; the only thing<br />
        done after emitting the event is closing the socket to the uplink hub.<br />
