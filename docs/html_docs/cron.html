Denora CRON Events<br />
<br />
1) Introduction<br />
2) Cron Events<br />
3) Triggered Events List<br />
<br />
1) Introduction to CRON Events<br />
<br />
	Much like the *nix system CRON, Denora has a built in system allowing module developers the ablitiy to have
their code execute at a given time of the day without having to be present or determine what time it is. The defined
event time are listed below. The rest of the documentation assumes that you are used to writing modules for the Denora
system.
<br />
<br />
2) Cron Events<br />
<br />
    A) All functions most be formatted as:<br />
<pre>
        int functioname(char *name);<br />
</pre>
    B) In DenoraInit you must declare CronEvent in some fashion; it is into
       this variable that we will create the cron event handler. Here is what
       the base DenoraInit should look like at this point:<br />
<br />
<pre>
        int DenoraInit(int argc, char **argv)
        {
            CronEvent *cevt = NULL;
            int status;

            moduleAddAuthor(AUTHOR);
            moduleAddVersion(VERSION);
            return MOD_CONT;
        }
</pre>
    C) Pass "createCronEvent" the name of the event. In this case we are
       going to hook time event of midnight, "CRON_MIDNIGHT".<br />
<pre>
        cevt = createCronEventHook(CRON_MIDNIGHT, midnight_check);
</pre>
    D) The Handler is not ready for use yet; now you must add it to the hash
       with "moduleAddCronEvent". You will want to pass to this function the
       return of "createCronEvent"<br />
<pre>
        status = moduleAddCronEvent(cevt);<br />
</pre>
       It will return the same module error codes as adding a regular message,
       which you can use to confirm it was added correctly.<br />
<br />
    E) With that setup in your function you will be passed 1 item. The message
       is very simple; it could be as simple as a start, stop or message. In
       the case of saving it has a start and stop.<br />
<pre>
        int midnight_check(char *name)
        {
         /* its midnight transfer current users over to daily users */
           stats->daily_users = stats_users;
            return MOD_CONT;
        }
</pre>
3) Triggered Events List<br />
<br />
    Here's a list of all event hooks we currently offer, with a description
    of what argument is being passed to the event functions for this type of
    event. <br />
