============================================================================

1) Introduction

Creating an IRCD Module for Denora is rather simple, however it does 
require knowledge of both C language, the IRCD protocol. The base API is de
scribed below, it is meant to guide through the basics of creating IRCD 
Modules. Since IRCD Protocols are complex and very hard to understand, this 
documentent is not meant to solve these problems just explain how the 
framework functions.

Denora supports TSora v3, v5 and v6 (TS3, TS5, TS6), and P10 (ircu)
protocols. This cover the majority of the current and past ircds. Should
your ircd not fit within these types please contact the Denora Dev team
to see about supporting your protocol.

============================================================================

2) Preparing to add new IRCD

    In preparing to add an IRCD module to Denora, first you will want to be
    on the most current SVN version of Denora, to ensure that you are using
    the most current code base, as changes are frequent its best to have the
    most current.

    Before going to far its best to look in toe src/protocol folder and 
    locate the ircd which most closely matches the ircd that you want to add
    support for. Make a copy of the .c and .h file from the src/protocol and 
    name them after the ircd that you are adding. For this example we will be 
    making an ircd called "quakeircd" (http://sourceforge.net/projects/quakeircd/)

    A) So we would rename the unreal32.c and unreal32.h to be quakeircd.c and
       quakeircd.h 

    B) In the sql/ folder there is a sql table file for the ircd, again we will
       take unreal32.sql and rename it to be quakeircd.sql

    C) Open src/protocol/Makefile.win32 and in the SRCS= section append the ircd
       name set in step A.

    You are now ready to start getting into the code.

============================================================================


3) Modifying the Header File

    Now that you have gotten past the first part of the creation process, you
    are into the code. This part is the harder and more complex part. You
    will need a general understanding of C code to continue. Here are the
    step by step instructions required to make this work.

    Open the .h file and find the section of code with the User Modes these
    are a series of UMODE_ based on the letter of the mode, starting with
    the hex of 0x00000001, add each User mode that with a UMODE_ up to the
    hex of 0x80000000, do not overlap the modes.

    Do the same with CMODE_ this is the channel modes that Denora will know
    about, do not include +o (oper), +v (voice), +h (halfop), +q (owner),
    +a (admin).

    Next there are a series of _cmd_ these are the base commands you must have
    these in your .c file this will be covered in the next section you will 
    want to name the first part of the function after your ircd. In our case
    we are going to rename unreal_cmd_eob(); to be quakeircd_cmd_eob();

    Lastly you need may want to strip down the _event_ functions, or leave them 
    alone till later till you find any events functions that you are not using.
    You can also add more events as you feel you need to make the file 100%
    complaint with the ircd

============================================================================

4) The Code

    Here is where the code of the .c file comes in. Be prepared to spend at
    least an hour, if not longer, going over the code and getting it right;
    Especially if you are setting up an ircd that is completely different
    than the one you used as a base. This section covers the majority of the
    code that is in use. 

    The first bit of code you will face is:

     #include "quakeircd.h"

    You need to include the .h file that you are building with. This is very
    important.

    Now you've come to the part where you setup your ircd. There are two
    structs which hold this information; This allows you to quickly setup
    your specific ircd.

        IRCDVar myircd[] = { }

    This struct contains your basic IRCd functions. Your base source file has
    the list of all available variables; note that you should not swap any
    around, or you will break stuff. Here is a brief description of the usage
    of each.

    1) Name: This member tells Denora about the IRCD's name. It may contain
             text about it's name and version. This is used to identify the
             build on startup.

    2) StatServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Denora on StatServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    3) VHOST: Can a user's host be changed on the fly? Enabling this allow
               HostServ online. Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    4) SGLINE: Does the IRCd support realname (geocs) bans? Use 1 for yes,
               0 for no. 

    5) SGLINE TABLE : If yes to #4 does the IRCD send the SGLINE as its own 
                      ban (1 yes), or as part of the general Glines (0 no).

    6) SQLINE: Does the IRCd support nick bans? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    7) SQLINE TABLE: If yes to #4 does the IRCD send the SQLINE as its own 
                     ban (1 yes), or as part of the general Glines (0 no).

    8) SZLINE: Does the IRCd support SZLINES? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    9) Exceptions: Support for channel exceptions (mode +e). Use 1 for yes,
                    0 for no.

    10) vIdent: Support for including a user's ident in their vHost. Use
                1 for yes, 0 for no.

    11) Vhost On Nick: On NICK the IRCd sends the VHOST. Use 1 for yes,
                       0 for no.

    12) NICKIP: The IP address of new users is being sent along with their
                hostname when new users are being introduced on the network.
                Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    13) Flood Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for blocking floods. Use 1 for
                    yes, 0 for no.

    14) Link Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for linking a channel to some
                   other channel. Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    15) CMode F: CMODE_ that defines flood mode. Use 0 for no support.

    16) CMode L: CMODE_ that defines link mode. Use 0 for no support.

    17) Tokens: Can we use tokens to talk to the IRCd? Use 1 for yes,
                0 for no.

    18) Token Case Senstive: Are the IRCd's TOKENS/COMMANDS case sensitive?
                             Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    19) base64 SJOIN TS: Are the timestamps sent with a SJOIN in base64? Use
                         1 for yes, 0 for no.

    20) Supports +I: Does the IRCd support channelmode +I? Use 1 for yes,
                     0 for no.

    21) SJOIN Ban Char: Character used to identify bans. Use ''.

    22) SJOIN Except Char: Character used to identify exceptions. use ''.

    23) Vhost Umode: UMODE_ that indicates if the user currently has a vHost.
                     Use 0 for no support.

    24) Owner: Is channel mode +q for owner supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.

    25) PROTECT: Is channel mode +a for protect/admin supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.

    26) HALFOP: Is channel mode +h for halfop supported by the IRCd? Use 1 for
                yes, 0 for no.

    27) Flood Mode Character: The character used to represent the channel flood mode, 
                              if this is supported by the IRCd.

    28) Alt Flood Mode Character: The alternative character used to represent the channel 
                                  flood mode, if this is supported by the IRCd.

    30) Vhost Character: The character used to represent the vHost mode, if
                         this is supported by the IRCd.

    31) Alt Vhost Character: The alternative character used to represent the vHost mode,  
                             if this is supported by the IRCd.

    32) P10: Is this IRCd a P10-style IRCd? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    33) TS6: Is this IRCd a TS6-style IRCd? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    34) Numerics: This ircd uses numerics to respond to things like MOTD, STATS? 
                  Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    35) Gagged : Has a channel mode that prevents the user from taking but the
                 user is not banned.

    So we've had this long list. Now there's a second struct to fill. This
    struct isn't as long as the previous one though, so we'll handle it quite
    quick compared to the previous one.

        IRCDCAPAB ircdcap[] = { }

    This struct is based on the CAPAB defines. You should review the CAPAB
    table below to see how this should be done.

============================================================================

5) Modes 

    The next thing you should do is defining the user modes. You will want to
    have your .h file handy for this part.

        unsigned long myumodes[128] = { }

    This array goes from 0 to 127 in the ASCII character set. Insert the user
    modes at the slot where the mode fits. If you are adding a the user mode
    of +i find the 105th (ASCII code of 'i') character slot in the array, and
    place the UMODE_i into this slot. Your base .c file should contain a good
    start for this, as well as a little help locating the characters.

    The following mode set is for the channel symbols. During a SJOIN event 
    the modes are sent usually before the nick. These normally are @, +, %
    etc.. depending on the ircd. Starting at ASCII 0 and running to 127. 
    Replace the 0 with the character (o = @, h = %) for the given mode. In the
    case of halfop which is usually sent as % replace the 37th character with
    'h', do this until all modes that are possible be received in this manor 
    have been inserted into the array.

    Now that you have that complete, the following array is ready to be dealt
    with. This is the cmmodes array, like the others it is a ASCII array
    starting at 0 and going to 127. However at the given letter you will want
    to enter the add, and delete function for the given mode. In the case of
    bans (+b) there is add_ban, and del_ban. Denora provides functions for 
    bans, exceptions and invites, should your ircd have more then these please
    contact Denora to discuss what can be done to add this mode.

============================================================================

6) Functions and Events

    A brief word about functions and events. There is more detail below on
    what events should pass their information to along with what is passed
    to each Command function. All events are captured using:

        void moduleAddIRCDMsgs(void)
        {
            m = createMessage("NICK", denora_event_nick); 
            addCoreMessage(IRCD,m);
        }

    Each event should have a event handler if its important enough to be
    processed by services. All event functions should be formed like this:

        int Denora_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)
        {
            return MOD_CONT;
        }

    They will receive the source; this can be NULL at times depending on the
    event. Next, ac is the number of arguments that are in the event, and av
    holds the values for each; so av[0] is the first variable, av[1] will be
    the second one, and so on. Events are likely to pass to various upper
    level event handlers; see the previous ircd source for how they handle
    these events.

    All commands are formed like this:

        void quakeircd_cmd_join(char *user, char *channel, time_t chantime)
        {
         send_cmd(ServerName, "%s !%s %s :%s",
             send_token("SJOIN", "~"), base64enc((long int) chantime),
             channel, user);
        }

    They may take any number of arguments, depending on the command. They
    should eventually come to a send_cmd(); this root function is how
    commands are sent to the IRCd.

       The Commands are setup in the function

       void moduleAddIRCDCmds() 
        {
         pmodule_cmd_join(quakeircd_cmd_join);
        }

    each of the core command functions has a pmodule_cmd which takes the
    information out of the module and allows the core to use it. Remember 
    you must have the core set of commands in your module. Even if you
    have to put in

        void quakeircd_cmd_pass(char *pass)
        {
        /* not used */
        }

============================================================================

7) The last part of Setup

Once you have completed the task of setting up Commands and Events you
come to the last bit of code that needs to be dealt with and that is the init
function of your IRCD Module. The DenoraInit has some key variables setup

    moduleAddAuthor("Denora");
    moduleAddVersion("$Id: IRCD 242 2005-05-16 15:42:14Z crazy $");
    moduleSetType(PROTOCOL);
    pmodule_ircd_version("QuakeIRCD");
    pmodule_ircd_cap(myIrcdcap);
    pmodule_ircd_var(myIrcd);
    pmodule_ircd_useTSMode(0);
    pmodule_oper_umode(UMODE_o);
    pmodule_ircd_cbmodeinfos(myCbmodeinfos);
    pmodule_ircd_cbmodes(myCbmodes);
    pmodule_ircd_cmmodes(myCmmodes);
    pmodule_ircd_csmodes(myCsmodes);
    pmodule_ircd_umodes(myumodes);
    moduleAddIRCDCmds();
    moduleAddIRCDMsgs();


moduleAddAuthor, allows you to set your name as the author of the module
this is displayed when viewing the module list.

moduleAddVersion, we recommend setting this to $Id: IRCD 242 2005-05-16 15:42:14Z crazy $ when impoted to our
svn it will get the above formatted version, this is best for debugging 
problems that might come up

moduleSetType, you must set this to PROTOCOL as it tells Denora that you
are loading in a IRCD Module.

pmodule_ircd_version : sets up the IRC Protocol display that is shown to
the user as they load your module

pmodule_ircd_cap : setup the capab variables, you should pass the ircdcap
variable struct to this function so it can be passed up to the core

pmodule_ircd_var : setup the ircd variables, you should pass the ircd
variable struct to this function so it can be passed up to the core

pmodule_ircd_useTSMode : Should your ircd send time stamped modes but not
tell us during CAPAB then this must be set to 1, otherwise leave at 0

pmodule_oper_umode : the user mode that defines the base line ircop mode

pmodule_ircd_cbmodeinfos : setup the cbmodeinfo struct

pmodule_ircd_cbmodes : setup the cbmodes

pmodule_ircd_cmmodes : setup the cmmodes

pmodule_ircd_csmodes : setup the csmodes

pmodule_ircd_umodes : setup the umodes

moduleAddIRCDCmds : should be called to setup your commands

moduleAddIRCDMsgs : should be called to setup your events
