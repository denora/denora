2. PRESENTATION
---------------

    Denora is a set of Stats Services for IRC networks that allows IRC
    network admins to get a complete and comprehensive overview of their
    IRC network. Denora exports this information to MySQL, HTML XML and
    flatfile databases.
    
    Denora's StatServ pseudo client, provides access to commands that
    allow to manage and view the network stats.

    Denora Stats coupled with phpDenora[1] or MagIRC[1] is the most powerful tool
    for generating statistics for IRC.

    Denora currently works with the following IRCds:

        * Bahamut 1.4 and 1.8
        * Charybdis 1.0 - 3.x
        * Inspircd 1.1.x - 2.0.x
        * IRCU 2.10.11 - 2.10.12
        * ircd-rizon 3.x.x
        * Nefarious IRCu 1.3.x - 2.0.x
        * Ratbox 2.0.6
        * ScaryNet IRCu 2.10.11 - 2.10.12
        * Unreal 3.2 beta19 or later
        * syntaxIRCd 1.0.1 or later

    Denora could also work with some of the deamons derivated by the ones 
    listed above.

5. CONTACT AND SUPPORT
----------------------

    * If you read the documentation carefully, which you also can find on our wiki
      (http://wiki.denorastats.org/) and didn't find the answer to your
      question, feel free to post on the website forums or join our IRC channel
      (irc.denorastats.org #denora). Be as precise as possible when asking a question,
      because we have no extraordinary powers and can't guess things if they aren't
      provided. The more precise you are, the sooner you'll be likely to get an answer.

    * If you think you found a bug, add it to the bug tracking system on our
      website (http://bugs.anope.org/) and - again - be as
      precise as possible. Also say whether the bug happens always or under what
      circumstances, and anything that could be useful to track your bug down.
      If you wrote a patch, send it over.

    * Support is also available via our forums located at
      http://forum.anope.org/
